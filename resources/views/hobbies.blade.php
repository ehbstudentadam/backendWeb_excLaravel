                    <p>I would be lying if joing the military hasn't changed me for the good. After going trough the program
                        and training, alot of friendships and good habits have grown on me. One of those good habits is
                        fitness.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Fitness</h2>
                    <p>After sharing my room with a gym fanatic I started to gain a bigger interest in building muscle and
                        getting fit. We started training together and I soon got the habbit of going to the gym regulary. I
                        have been doing fitness for about 6 years on and off. I have gained a lot of muscle but also lost
                        alot, the most difficult part of fitness is consistency. Once you can fit going to the gym in your
                        daily routine, making a habbit of going, you will see results.
                    </p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">Before and after many years of fitness.</span>

                    <p>I have gained alot of friendships when I joined the military, one common interest we all have
                        is traveling. We have visited alot of different parts of the world before covid was a thing.
                        Some parts were far away like Thailand but some were nearby like Dublin. Seeing and experiencing
                        different cultures has been verry interesting. Alot of stories have been made abroad with my
                        friends.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Traveling</h2>
                    <p>My first trip abroad with the plane was a far one. Thailand, it was a trip we have been planning
                        together with 3 of my friends for months. After one year of training, following classes and
                        living together we were verry excited to go and explore this paradise that has been foretold. </p>
                    <p>And what a paradise it was. Warm weather, white beaches, clear oceans and beathifull nature.
                        To not speak of all the ancient buildings, temples and Thai culture. Untill this day, this has
                        been my greatest trip.
                    </p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">My friends and the friends we've met along the way.</span>
                    <p>After returning back to Belgium I wanted to see more of the world and I did. I've returned and
                        visited Vietnam, went to see some closer cities like Prague, BoedaPest, Dublin, Berlin, Spain and
                        so on. The time I was working on the F16 I had the chance to join some of their training missions
                        abroad and I tried to get on every single one of them. I've been to Spain, Canada and alot more
                        with my work also. This was still work offcourse but nonetheless verry interesting.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Computers</h2>
                    <p>Before I joined the military I was a nerd you could say. I spent alot of time behind my computer,
                        I built them myself and had a big interest in technology. The internet was big and interesting,
                        it kept me engaged.
                    </p>
                    <p>All of this stopped when I decided to work as a technician in the military. I was busy with other 
                        stuff at the time and you have to keep up with the technology
                        because time in the world of IT advances verry fast. But nonetheless, I still kept in touch,
                        not as close as before but the interest never left me. </p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">I think the oldest photo I found of me with a computer.</span>

                    <p>After some time I missed working with computers. Every day I waited, not starting to learn about
                        informatics I felt wasted. I wanted to get back into the field of IT as soon as possible and 
                        catch up with the time i have missed. Not long after I got approved to follow 
                        a Bachelors Informatics provided by the military. I was, and still am verry excited to learn and
                        work in the field of IT. These days I study and keep busy with alot of interests that are
                        computer related like gaming, programming, cryptocurrency and hardware. There is alot to explore
                        and it keeps giving.</p>
